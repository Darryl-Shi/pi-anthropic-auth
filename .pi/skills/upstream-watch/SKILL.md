  Load-bearing assumptions this extension makes about upstream Pi, mapped to the
  upstream files that would falsify each one, plus the impact-class taxonomy for
  triaging a new Pi release.
  Load when assessing a new Pi/pi-ai release, diagnosing a version regression, or
  changing code that depends on upstream internals.

# Upstream Watch

This extension is a thin wrapper around upstream internals.
Every wrapper has assumptions, and upstream does not know it is holding them.
This skill lists those assumptions, names the file that would break each one, and classifies how the breakage shows up.

## Impact classes

Triage every candidate finding into one of three classes.
The classes differ in what detects them, and two of the three are not detected by the changelog.

| Class | Shows up as | Detected by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compile-time | `tsc` error against the new types | Scratch-tree typecheck. Free and deterministic. |
| Behavioral-silent | Shaping still runs but emits wrong output; requests still succeed | A canary test, or nothing |
| Coverage-gap | New upstream code path routes around our seam entirely | Reading the watchlist diff. Nothing else. |

Behavioral-silent is the most dangerous class for this package.
An OAuth request that is shaped incorrectly still returns 200, so no user reports it and no test fails unless a canary exists for that specific assumption.

Coverage-gap findings are invisible to both the changelog and the test suite, because from our side nothing changed.
This is the reason the watchlist below is diffed unconditionally rather than only when a changelog entry points at it.

## The watchlist

Diff each of these between the installed tag and the new tag, regardless of what the changelogs say.
Paths are relative to `~/development/pi/pi`.

| Our assumption | Upstream file | Breaks as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `anthropicMessagesApi().streamSimple` is exported from the compat entrypoint | `packages/ai/src/compat.ts`, `packages/ai/src/api/anthropic-messages.lazy.ts` | Coverage-gap (our resolver throws at load) |
| `registerProvider` merges over prior registrations, including over another extension's registration of a config-named provider; `unregisterProvider` exists | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`, `core/extensions/runner.ts` | Compile-time or coverage-gap (a named provider loses its owner's `oauth`/`models`, or our wrapper) |
| An extension-only provider without its own `streamSimple` falls through to `getApiProvider(model.api)`, the same bare transport our wrapper delegates to | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts` (`streamWith`) | Behavioral-silent (wrapping a config-named provider stops being pass-through for non-OAuth requests) |
| `getAgentDir()` is exported from the `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` root and honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | `packages/coding-agent/src/config.ts`, `src/index.ts` | Compile-time, or the global config silently not read |
| `session_start` is awaited before the first request, and its ctx carries `cwd` and `isProjectTrusted()` | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/agent-session.ts` (`bindExtensions`), `core/extensions/types.ts` | Coverage-gap (the first request on a project-named provider goes out unshaped) |
| `provider-composer` routes the main loop and compaction through our wrapper | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/provider-composer.ts` (`streamWith`) | Coverage-gap |
| `ModelRegistry.streamSimple` delegates to `ModelRuntime.streamSimple`, the supported path `docs/architecture.md` recommends for background agents (Issue #53) | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`, `core/model-runtime.ts` | Coverage-gap (background agents on the supported path go unshaped) |
| The agent-core default-stream fallback stays legacy-only: `getDefaultStreamFn` unexported, `streamFn` required in the types (Issue #53) | `packages/agent/src/index.ts`, `src/types.ts`, `src/agent-loop.ts` | Coverage-gap (if it becomes a first-class path, re-evaluate the rejected provider-aware `setDefaultStreamFn` override) |
| OAuth `params.system` is `[identity, prompt]` text blocks | `packages/ai/src/api/anthropic-messages.ts` (`params.system`) | Behavioral-silent |
| `messages[]` carries `role: "system"` entries only for section updates and per-message effort, both handled by `shapeSystemRoleMessages` | `packages/ai/src/api/anthropic-messages.ts` (`convertMessages`, `insertThinkingLevelMessages`) | Coverage-gap (a new system-message kind reaches Anthropic unshaped, or is dropped when shaping empties it) |
| Managed-effort models (`compat.supportsMidConvoEffort`) pin top-level `output_config.effort` to `"high"` and carry the requested effort in content-less `role: "system"` messages with `output_config` (PR #79) | `packages/ai/src/api/anthropic-messages.ts` (`insertThinkingLevelMessages`) | Behavioral-silent (the keep rule goes dead, or effort is lost); `test/managed-effort-drift.test.ts` alarms |
| Pi's default prompt is an untagged preamble plus `<name>` sections matching `PI_OWNED_SECTIONS` and our anchors | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts` (`buildSystemPromptSections`), `packages/ai/src/utils/text.ts` (`getSystemMessageText`) | Behavioral-silent |
| Mid-conversation section updates keep the `Updated/Removed system prompt section "<name>"` framing | `packages/ai/src/utils/text.ts` (`renderSystemMessageUpdate`) | Behavioral-silent |
| Requests without an `sk-ant-oat` token pass through untouched, including Anthropic workload identity federation (pi 0.99.2), which reaches our wrapper with no `apiKey` and its ids in `options.env` | `packages/ai/src/api/anthropic-messages.ts` (`getAnthropicFederation`), `packages/ai/src/providers/anthropic.ts` | Behavioral-silent (a non-OAuth path gets shaped, or loses the caller's `fetch`) |
| Built-in extension sections such as `mcp_servers` (pi 0.99.2) carry neutral text, so shaping keeps them byte-identical, including their mid-conversation re-sends | `packages/coding-agent/src/extensions/mcp/index.ts` (`renderServersSection`) | Behavioral-silent (Pi identity text in such a section reaches Anthropic unshaped) |
| Login and refresh stay delegated to the built-in `anthropicOAuth` | `packages/ai/src/oauth*`, coding-agent auth wiring | Compile-time or runtime throw |
| `claudeCodeVersion` in pi's user-agent vs. our `cc_version` pin | `packages/ai/src/api/anthropic-messages.ts` (`claudeCodeVersion`) | One rejected round trip, then recovered at the named floor (Issue #75); a hard failure only when the override is set or the floor is unnamed |
| Anthropic names the floor as `version X.Y.Z or newer is required` in a `claude_code_version_too_old` 400 | Anthropic API (no upstream file); `src/version-rejection.ts` | Behavioral-silent (recovery degrades to a hint) |
| Native `pi.registerProvider(provider: Provider)` registers a login-only provider with no models, and `unregisterProvider` removes it; a provider with `auth.oauth` appears in `/login` | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts` (`registerNativeProvider`), `core/extensions/loader.ts`, `modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts` (`getLoginProviderOptions`) | Compile-time, or the account slots vanish from `/login` |
| `ModelRegistry.getProvider("anthropic").auth.oauth` is the built-in Claude OAuth method, reusable by another provider id | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`, `core/provider-composer.ts` (`composeOAuthAuth`), `packages/ai/src/providers/anthropic.ts` | Coverage-gap (no slots registered; the pool stays single-account) |
| `getProviderAuthStatus` reports a stored credential for every `auth.json` key, registered provider or not | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts` (`getProviderAuthStatus`, `runAvailabilityRefresh`) | Behavioral-silent (a logged-in slot is not found until registered) |
| `getApiKeyForProvider` refreshes an expiring OAuth token under Pi's lock before returning it | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-registry.ts`, `packages/ai/src/models.ts` (`getAuth`) | Behavioral-silent (an extra account is sent an expired token, gets a 401, and is set aside) |
| `options.sessionId` is set on main-loop and compaction requests | `packages/agent/src/agent.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/compaction/compaction.ts` | Behavioral-silent (sessions stop pinning; compaction may land on a cold account) |
| OAuth responses carry `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-{5h,7d}-utilization` (0..1), `-status`, and `-reset`; `GET /api/oauth/usage` reports the same windows as 0..100 | Anthropic API (no upstream file); `src/account-usage.ts` | Behavioral-silent (placement degrades to session counts) |
| New auxiliary request paths still reach `ModelRuntime` | any new caller (cache warmer, background agents, extension model APIs) | Coverage-gap (unshaped OAuth request) |

The last row has no fixed path on purpose.
Each release may add a new component that issues provider requests.
Check what transport it calls: `ModelRuntime.streamSimple` reaches our wrapper, pi-ai's bare `compat.streamSimple` does not.

## Read both changelogs

This package peers on two upstream packages, and the interesting entries are not reliably in the one you were handed.

1. `packages/ai/CHANGELOG.md`
2. `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md`

For pi 0.86.0 the coding-agent changelog was the higher-signal one: it announced `ctx.modelRegistry.stream()`/`streamSimple()` for extension model calls (relevant to Issue #46 and Issue #53) and prompt cache warming (a new recurring provider request path).
Neither changelog mentioned that the default system prompt had been restructured into XML-tagged sections, which was the change that actually broke shaping.

Read the Breaking Changes section of every intervening version, not only the newest.

## Verification gotchas

Two snags reliably cost time in the scratch tree.

1. Fresh upstream releases trip the lockfile age gate.
   Clear it with `pnpm clean --lockfile && pnpm install`, then expect other devDeps to move within their caret ranges.
2. `pnpm run check` and `pnpm test` re-run `pnpm install` through pnpm's deps-status gate, which fails on `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` (esbuild) in a fresh tree.
   Call the binaries directly instead: `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` and `./node_modules/.bin/vitest run`.

Typecheck cannot see the runtime resolution surface, because our delegate is resolved through a dynamic import the compiler does not follow.
Probe it directly against the new `dist/`:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "
import * as ns from './node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/compat.js';
console.log(typeof ns.anthropicMessagesApi?.().streamSimple);
"
```

## Scoping blast radius

When a finding depends on a model capability flag, enumerate the catalog rather than assuming it applies everywhere.

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "
import {getBuiltinModels} from './node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/providers/all.js';
for (const m of getBuiltinModels('anthropic')) console.log(m.id, JSON.stringify(m.compat ?? {}));
"
```

Pi 0.86.0's mid-conversation system messages, for example, are gated on `compat.supportsMidConvoSystemMessages`, which only four flagship models set.
A finding that affects four models is a different priority from one that affects all of them.

## Version-agnostic typing

When upstream narrows a type we pass straight through, prefer deriving our signature from the delegate over importing the new type name.

```typescript
context: Parameters<AnthropicStreamSimpleDelegate>[1]
```

This typechecks against every version in the supported peer range, so it fixes the build without forcing a peer-floor bump.
Import the new type name only when we actually need to construct or inspect the value.
